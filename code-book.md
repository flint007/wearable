#Code Book for the wearable study

## new variable for this tidy set
"subject" - 30 participants from the original study
"activity" - 6 activities from the original study

## inherited variables from the original study
for this analysis, I borrowed the original variables from the features.txt and appended "-Mean" to it. It should
suffice the descriptive nature for this tidy set and honor the prior art.
